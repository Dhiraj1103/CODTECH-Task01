### Project Overview: Basic Calculator with Python and Tkinter

#### Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a simple calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's tkinter library. The calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Features:
1. *Graphical User Interface (GUI):* 
   - An entry field to display the expression being entered and the result.
   - Buttons for digits (0-9) and decimal point.
   - Buttons for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
   - An equal button to evaluate the expression.
   - A clear button to reset the entry field.

2. *Functionality:*
   - Users can input a sequence of numbers and operations, which will be displayed in the entry field.
   - Upon pressing the equal button, the entered expression will be evaluated and the result will be displayed.
   - The clear button will clear the current input in the entry field.

#### Components:
1. *Entry Field:*
   - A single line text field (tk.Entry) where users can see the current input and the result of calculations.

2. *Buttons:*
   - Digit buttons (0-9) and a decimal point button (.)
   - Operation buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
   - Equal button (=) to evaluate the entered expression.
   - Clear button (C) to clear the input field.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. *Setup the Main Window:*
   - Initialize the main window using tk.Tk().
   - Set the title and size of the window.

2. *Create the Entry Field:*
   - Add an entry widget to the window for displaying the input and results.

3. *Define Button Functions:*
   - *Evaluate Expression:* A function to evaluate the mathematical expression entered by the user and display the result.
   - *Append Character:* A function to append characters (digits, operations) to the entry field.
   - *Clear Entry:* A function to clear the entry field.

4. *Create and Position Buttons:*
   - Create button widgets for digits, operations, equal sign, and clear.
   - Use grid layout to position the buttons in a calculator-like arrangement.

5. *Main Loop:*
   - Run the Tkinter event loop using root.mainloop() to keep the application running.

#### Code Overview:
The provided code demonstrates the creation of the calculator with the following key sections:

- *Importing Libraries:* Import the tkinter library.
- *Function Definitions:* Define functions for evaluating expressions, appending characters, and clearing the entry field.
- *Creating Widgets:* Create the main window, entry field, and buttons.
- *Positioning Widgets:* Use the grid layout to position the buttons and entry field.
- *Running the Application:* Start the Tkinter event loop to run the application.

This project serves as a great introduction to GUI programming in Python and demonstrates how to create a functional application using basic tkinter widgets and event handling.
